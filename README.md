# Squadron-Roster

Currently at a local Civil Air Patrol squadron (and other squadrons around the nation), staff are using an excel spreadsheet to track all of 
the cadets in their units. They are having to enter all of the data manually as they advance and complete promotion requirements. They are also 
having to send out individual emails to every cadet about once a month to tell them what they need to do in order to promote and when they are eligible
to promote next.

This program is for squadrons to help them track cadets in their units. This program allows squadrons to add information to a squadron roster, 
add and remove cadets from their rosters, track their cadets’ promotion information, allow for cadets to see their own information, and allow for 
easier and detailed organization of data information.

Program areas: Add and remove cadets from the squadron roster, Track cadets’ promotions and ranks, Track cadets’ promotion requirements, Allow for cadets
to access their information, Allow for squadron staff to access the entire roster.
